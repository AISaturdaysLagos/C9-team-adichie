# Pluvial Flood Susceptibility Prediction

This project is part of AI Saturdays Lagos initiative to develop a model that can predict pluvial (surface water) flood susceptibility.
The project utilizes a dataset centered on the Ibadan Metropolis in Oyo State, Nigeria, assessing various environmental and topographical factors to predict flood risk.

## Project Description

Increasing climate variability and rapid urbanization have heightened the risk of flooding, posing a significant threat to lives and economies. This project aims to address the challenge of **pluvial flood risk** by building a machine learning model.

The goal is to develop a **Susceptibility Assessment Application (SUSAP)** that can detect and predict areas susceptible to pluvial floods. By analyzing several key environmental variables, the model will help in managing and mitigating potential flood risks in urban areas. The dataset for this study was collected for the Ibadan Metropolis, Nigeria, from sources like the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the Copernicus Climate Data Store.

## Dataset

The dataset contains **144,401 records** from five local government areas in Ibadan. It was generated by identifying key conditioning variables related to pluvial floods and interpreting satellite imagery (SRTM DEM) using ArcGIS software.

### Data Files

The primary data is contained in a single file, `Pluvial_Flood_Dataset.xlsx`, which includes both the features and the target variable for training and evaluation.

### Features (Conditioning Variables)

The dataset includes eight key conditioning variables that influence pluvial flooding:

1.  **Elevation**: The height of the land above sea level.
2.  **Slope**: The steepness of the terrain.
3.  **Topographic Wetness Index (TWI)**: Quantifies the effect of topography on the location and size of saturated source areas.
4.  **Stream Power Index (SPI)**: Measures the erosive power of overland flow.
5.  **Land Use**: The type of land cover (e.g., urban, vegetation, water bodies).
6.  **Geology**: The type of rock and soil formations.
7.  **Rainfall**: Precipitation data for the area.
8.  **Drainage Density**: The total length of all streams and rivers in a drainage basin divided by the total area of the basin.

The **target variable** is a classification of flood susceptibility (e.g., Low, Medium, High risk).


## Getting Started 

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.x
  * Jupyter Notebook or your preferred IDE
  * Required Python libraries:
      * `pandas`
      * `numpy`
      * `scikit-learn`
      * `matplotlib`
      * `seaborn`
      * `xgboost`, `lightgbm`, or `catboost`
      * `geopandas` (for geospatial analysis)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://docs.github.com/organizations
    ```
2.  Install the required libraries from the `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1.  Place the Kaggle dataset file in a `data` directory.
2.  Use the notebooks in the `notebooks` directory for data exploration, feature engineering, and model development.
3.  Store final scripts and reusable code in the `src` directory.


## Methodology/Approach

This section will be updated as the team finalizes its strategy. A potential workflow includes:

  * **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the statistical distributions and relationships between the different conditioning variables.
  * **Geospatial Visualization**: Create maps to visualize the spatial patterns of the features and flood-prone areas.
  * **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
  * **Model Selection**: Experiment with various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines, and Neural Networks.
  * **Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning**: Train the selected models and optimize their parameters for the best performance.


## Evaluation

The performance of the classification model will be evaluated using standard metrics such as:

  * **Accuracy**
  * **Precision**
  * **Recall**
  * **F1-Score**
  * **Confusion Matrix**
  * **Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)**
